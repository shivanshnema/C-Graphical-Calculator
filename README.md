C Programming Language is the starting point for most of the programmers. We try to learn basic syntax and semantics from the language. This calculator is made by me when I was in starting stage of my programming life. This helped in understanding C Graphics and Mouse Programming.  

Calculator does basic calculations like add, subtract, multiply, division of two or more than two numbers.
